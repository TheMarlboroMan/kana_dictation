# kana_dictation
Japanese Kana training application: generates random romaji sillables for you to translate into the japanese sillabaries. Then shows the hiragana or katakana for them. Written entirely in SDL2 and C++ so it can be ported to a variety of systems.

Features:

- Choose from hiragana or katakana sillabaries to practice.
- Choose from 1 or 20 sillables to practice at once.
- Configurable kana database via json-like files, in case I forgot to put some in.
- Quick and to the point.

Planned features:

- Save user preferences to configuration files.
- Multiple languages in the user interface.
- Allow for user selected sillable groups (ie. practice only the vowels and the "K" group).
- Quick translation from the command line (input the romaji sillables to get the kana on the console or screen).
- Support for multiple screen modes (if SDL2 allows it). So far it's only 800x500, windowed.
